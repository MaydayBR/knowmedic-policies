  <h1>Privacy Policy for Knowmedic</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: August 25, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Knowmedic (“<strong>Knowmedic</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”, or “<strong>us</strong>”) operates the Knowmedic mobile application (the “<strong>App</strong>”). This policy describes what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & Profile Data</strong>: email address and basic profile info (e.g., display name, photo) when you sign up via Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>App Content You Save</strong>: items such as folders, bookmarks, and preferences you create in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & Device Data</strong>: app interactions, diagnostic events, and crash logs (via Firebase services such as Analytics/Crash Reporting if enabled), device model/OS, and a non-permanent device identifier.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Communications</strong>: messages you send to us (e.g., email).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>We do not sell personal data. We do not collect your precise location, contacts, or photos.</em></p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core functionality (authentication, syncing your saved items).</li>
    <li>Improve performance, reliability, and security (analytics, debugging, fraud prevention).</li>
    <li>Personalize in-app experience and surface relevant content.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates or support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sources & Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Knowmedic displays public research information retrieved from the PubMed API (National Library of Medicine). PubMed content is <em>not</em> your personal data.</p>
  <p>We use trusted vendors to operate the App, including (by example) <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore/Database, Cloud Functions, Analytics/Crash Reporting). These processors handle data on our behalf in accordance with their policies.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We share personal data only with service providers that help run the App, and as required by law or to protect rights and safety. We do not sell personal data.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep your account data while your account is active. If you delete your account, we delete or anonymize personal data within a reasonable period, except where we are required to retain limited information (e.g., security logs or backups) for a short time.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your account and associated in-app data at any time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the App: <em>Settings → Delete Account</em> (this triggers removal of your account and your top-level folders/bookmarks stored in our database), or</li>
    <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:bmayday20@gmail.com">bmayday20@gmail.com</a> and we’ll assist.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Update</strong> your account info in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account as described above.</li>
    <li>If you are in a region
