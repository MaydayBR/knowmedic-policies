  <h1>Privacy Policy for Knowmedic</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: August 25, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Knowmedic (“<strong>Knowmedic</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) operates the Knowmedic mobile application (the “<strong>App</strong>”). This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>The data controller is <strong>Knowmedic</strong> (Bryce Mayday), based in the United States. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:bmayday20@gmail.com">bmayday20@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & Profile Data</strong>: email address and basic profile info (e.g., display name, photo) when you sign up via Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>App Content You Save</strong>: items you create in the App such as folders, bookmarks, and preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & Device Data</strong>: in-app events, diagnostics, and crash logs (if enabled), device model/OS, and a non-permanent device identifier.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Communications</strong>: messages you send to us (e.g., email).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>We do not sell personal data. We do not collect your precise GPS location, contacts, or photos.</em></p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core functionality (authentication, syncing your saved items).</li>
    <li>Improve performance, reliability, and security (analytics, debugging, fraud prevention).</li>
    <li>Personalize the in-app experience and surface relevant content.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates or support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ads & Cross-App Tracking</h2>
  <p>We do not show third-party ads, do not use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA), and do not track you across other companies’ apps or websites for advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>Data Sources & Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App displays public research information retrieved from the PubMed API (U.S. National Library of Medicine). PubMed content is not your personal data.</p>
  <p>We use service providers to operate the App, including (by example) <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore/Database, Cloud Functions, and optional Analytics/Crash Reporting). These vendors process data on our behalf under their terms and policies.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We share personal data only with service providers that help run the App, and with authorities when required by law or to protect rights and safety. We do not sell personal data.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep your account data while your account is active. When you delete your account, we begin removal of associated personal data promptly. We may retain limited information only where necessary to comply with law, resolve disputes, or prevent abuse.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your account and associated in-app data at any time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the App: <em>Settings → Delete Account</em> (removes your account and your top-level saved items), or</li>
    <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:bmayday20@gmail.com">bmayday20@gmail.com</a> and we’ll assist.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Update</strong> your account info in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account as described above.</li>
    <li>Where applicable (e.g., EEA/UK/California), you may request access, correction, deletion, or portability by contacting us. We will verify your request as required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to create and maintain your account and provide the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to secure, debug, and improve the App (e.g., crash/diagnostic data).</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – where required for optional features; you can withdraw consent at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>California Privacy (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
  <p>We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by the CPRA, and we do not use targeted advertising. California residents may request access or deletion by emailing <a href="mailto:bmayday20@gmail.com">bmayday20@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>We are based in the United States. If you use the App from another country, your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S., where privacy laws may differ.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures (e.g., TLS in transit and restricted access) to protect personal data. No method is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above and, when appropriate, notify you in the App.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
